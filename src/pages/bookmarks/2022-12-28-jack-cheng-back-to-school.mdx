This quote that he submitted to the Building Beauty course is very inspirational to me, as it's something I've been thinking about lately - why I like the things that I like, and how to make stuff like that myself:

> To hone my sense of beauty and deep time. To learn, in community, slower and more sustainable ways of building and making. To create spaces — both real and in my writing — that spark the soul.

Additionally from there, the founding principles of [Building Beauty](https://www.buildingbeauty.org/) are also very well written as a general life advice to follow.

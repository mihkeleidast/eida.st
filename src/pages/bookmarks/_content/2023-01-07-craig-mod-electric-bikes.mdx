A bike lover myself, I haven't yet pulled the trigger on an electric bike. I want one now.

> And on and on — bikes. Why? Because as any bike lover will tell you, to be ensorcelled by the bike is to crave one and only one thing: More bike. Each new bike is like riding once again for the first time. Exploring a city on a mamachari is different than a BD-1 is different than a Moulton. All thrilling. The bikes change, and so, too does your relationship to the pavement. My love for bikes has no categorical allegiances; if it has two wheels, and pedals, I’m interested. I want to ride them all.

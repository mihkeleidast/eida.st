An excellent write-up of how his year went. Something that inspired me [to do my own write-up](https://eida.st/thoughts/2023-01-01-year-in-review/).

I especially like the mental health section and the description of how his brain works:

> The best way I can describe my brain is as a boat with a sensitive rudder. Any thought or suggestion (internal or external) nudges the rudder in a different direction. It’s not uncorrectable, but it does divert course. Whatever I can do to lessen the nudges, the better. This all sounds negative but there’s a lot of positives that come with having a brain like this, as others know. You may forget to eat and show up 10 minutes late to an important meeting because reading a wikipedia article on whale songs took precedence, but I wouldn’t trade it for a neurotypical brain.

It's nice to recognize oneself in something others write about themselves. I'm not alone in this world.

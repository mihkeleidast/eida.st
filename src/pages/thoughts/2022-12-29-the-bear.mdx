Today I binge-watched [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/) on Disney+. I think I saw the series card when browsing there a while back, but then it didn't catch my attention. Some time ago a review of the show written in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/05/the-bear-review-should-you-watch-this-genius-kitchen-drama-immediately-yes-chef) popped in my feeds, and there were some interesting notes there that caught my attention.

The Bear is part dysfunctional family drama, part workplace drama, part crime drama, part kitchen & food drama - basically all of the things I can like about a show - so of course I enjoyed it! I guess the food nerd in me would have liked a bit more focus on the food, but overall it's still a top notch show to watch.

Only 8 episodes in the first season, each episode about half an hour long, so it also does not take up too much of anyone's time. A second season [is already confirmed](https://tvline.com/2022/07/14/the-bear-renewed-season-2-fx-hulu-jeremy-allen-white/), due sometime next year.

_Yes, chef!_

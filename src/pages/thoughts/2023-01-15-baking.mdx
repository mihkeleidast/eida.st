I've been more inspired recently than usual, and that has led me to spend a bit more time in the kitchen, mostly baking. Last week, one day I made [cinnamon-cardamom rolls](https://koogikontor.ee/2021/02/kaneeli-kardemonisaiad.html), another I baked a [cocoa-curd peat cake](https://nami-nami.ee/retsept/5014/turbakook_ehk_kakao_kohupiimakook) (estonian recipes, sorry). Baking's fun! I love messing around in the kitchen, especially if tasty treats come out afterwards.

That's the thought!

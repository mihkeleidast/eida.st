I've been more inspired recently than usual, and that has led me to spend a bit more time in the kitchen, mostly baking. Last week, one day I made cinnamon-cardamom rolls, another I baked a cocoa-curd peat cake. Baking's fun! I love messing around in the kitchen, especially if tasty treats come out afterwards.

That's the thought!

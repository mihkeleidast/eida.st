I turned 29 today.

I had a great day. I had planned a day full of cooking pancakes for friends & family with some hearty talking on the side. Got all that, so yay! Thanks to all who came. I wish I could have seen more of the people who mean the most to me. But I understand that life does not always work out that way, and I hope those who could not come are well wherever they need to be. Thanks to all of you too"

Happy happy happy. To an even better 29th! I hope for a lot before officially turning old next year.
